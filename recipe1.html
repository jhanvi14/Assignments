<h2>Recipes-World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
<p>
    I adopted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup>
    visit to Bill's Restaurant in King's Cross,Sydney. I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I
    really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
</p>
<p>
    This recipe is what I call a "Very special breakfast" , just look at the ingredients to see why.It has to be tasted to be believed.
